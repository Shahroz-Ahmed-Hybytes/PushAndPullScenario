#Steps we will follow for pull command
# Script will set in cd / .git/hooks/post-merge
# We will got to the directory where we want to pull our code either thats empty or already there is a code
# Secondly, we will will go to github 
# 
# #Steps 
#UPDATING CHANGING SO THAT WE CAN JUSTIFY THAT UPDATED CODE PULLED IN OUR LOCAL SYSTEM
#AS YOU CAN SEE THERE IS NOT ASSETS FOLDER IN THIS GITHUB and S3 FOLDER WILL BE PULL FROM AWS S3 
                 #Now i am going to run a Script directly.
                 #first it cloned git repo and pull in a specific folder
                 #then it will pull Assets folder from S3 and place in a cloned folder specific location. Where should be the Assets folder in a project.
                 #images are heavy thats why it took time to download.
                 #Now we will checkout code and that specific folder, either code pulled or not.
                 #Code & S3 Folder Pulled.
